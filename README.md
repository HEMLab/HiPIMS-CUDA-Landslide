# Introduction

The landslide modelling system is developed based on **Hi**gh-**P**erformance **I**ntegrated hydrodynamic
**M**odelling **S**ystem. It uses state-of-art numerical schemes
(Godunov-type finite volume) to solve the 2D shallow water equations for landslide simulations. To support high-resolution flood simulations, HiPIMS is implemented on multiple
GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) using CUDA/C++ languages to achieve high-performance computing. Since HiPIMS has a modular and flexible structure, it has a great potential to be further developed for other applications in hydrological science as long as the problem can be solved on a uniform rectangular grid. To find out how to use the model, please see the **[wiki](https://github.com/HEMLab/hipims/wiki)**.

# Contact

The official version of HiPIMS-CUDA-DebrisFlow is developed and maintained by the **[Hydro-Environmental Modelling Labarotory](http://www.hemlab.org)**, a research hub for technological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. The development of HiPIMS is led by Professor [Qiuhua Liang](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/abce/staff/qiuhua-liang/) and represents the effort of nearly two decades and many researchers.
